### Remarks
The bottom area of an embed that provides further information about anything.



Footers can also have timestamps, but that can be used by setting [Timestamp](Embed_Timestamp 'Guilded.NET.Base.Embeds.Embed.Timestamp') property. Timestamps are not officially part of footers, but that's the most common way they are displayed by the clients and official Guilded app.
