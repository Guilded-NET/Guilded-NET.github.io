# Getting Started: Getting bot's auth token

If you need a Guilded bot's token, make sure you have a server that you own or which you are admin of and can manage bots in. Click on the top left arrow next to the server's name on Guilded and press "Manage bots". There, below the list of bots, you should be able to see "Create bot". Change the name of the bot and then navigate to "API" tab and press on "Create token" button below. You should be presented with the token of your bot. Press `COPY` next to the token and it should be copied to your clipboard. You can paste the auth token wherever you would like to (in most cases, it would be to `config/config.json` file).
